            Inflammation is an immune response of the body to harmful external or internal stimuli. Chronic inflammation has been identified as a common link that runs through various clinical conditions/ diseases. Researchers from clinical and basic sciences, working in the field of inflammation, attended the 2-day scientific meet held in August 2015 at Bengaluru to initiate a crosstalk on role inflammation in non-communicable diseases. The meeting served as a platform for founding a national forum envisioned at strengthening the inflammation research in India.
